## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Text Formatting Basics
### Headers`# First Level Header``## Second Level Header``### Third Level Header`***

# First Level Header

## Second Level Header

### Third Level Header

### Bulleted or Numbered Lists
 * List element 1
 * List element 2
 * List element 3
  * List element 3a
  * List element 3b
  
Numbered Lists:

 1. Numbered list 1
 1. Numbered list 2
 1. Numbered list 3. The numbers auto-increment, have to worry about numbering!!!
 
 Numbered and unordered lists combined:
 1. Numbered list 1
 1. numbered list 2
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
  
  
### Text Formatting
* Make text italic like *this* or _this_. 
* Make text bold like **this** or __this__.
* Use `backticks` for code.
* Wrap a character to subscript in tildes (`~`). For example, `H~2~O` renders as H~2~O.
* Wrap a character to superscript in carets (`^`), like this: `R^2^` renders as R^2^.
